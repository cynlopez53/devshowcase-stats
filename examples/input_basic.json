- for input files like input_basic.json
- responses/ → for output files like output_basic.json
And inside each folder, you’ll paste the exact JSON I gave you earlier.

🧭 How to Add Them in GitHub
- Go to your repo
- Click “Add file” → “Create new file”
- In the filename box, type:
examples/input_basic.json
- Paste the content I gave you for that file
- Add a commit message like:
Add input_basic.json to examples
- Click “Commit new file”
Repeat for each file:
- examples/input_verbose.json
- examples/input_normalize.json
- examples/input_bad.json
- responses/output_basic.json
- responses/output_verbose.json
- responses/output_normalize.json
- responses/output_error.json

Once you’ve added those, your repo will be fully structured and ready to share, fork, or plug into your agent flows. Want help writing a short GitHub description or adding tags to boost discoverability?
